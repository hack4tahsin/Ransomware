**Preface**
--------------------
The GCD of two numbers is defined as the largest integer that divides both integers without remainder.

Recall that the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers a and b is the largest positive number that is a factor of both a and b. The lowest common multiple of a and b is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of a and b. We denote the greatest common divisor of a and b by

The LCM of two numbers is defined as the smallest integer which a multiple of both integers.

--------------------
**Example**
--------------------
Find the gcd and lcm of the following pairs.
a = 40 and b = 28

40 : 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 <br />
28 : 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

Thus, gcd(40, 28) = 4

For multiples we have
40 : 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 280, ...
28 : 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196, 224, 252, 280, ...

So, lcm(40, 28) = 280

**Program Utilization**
----------------------------
* A user inputs two integer numbers.
* These two integer numbers will act as arguments.
* Later, it will do its GCD and LCM calculation by receiving those arguments with the help of function parameters.
* It will return the GCD and LCM value after the completion of the program.
* User can print the value of GCD and LCM on their environment.
