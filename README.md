# Ransomware
Ransomware is malware that employs encryption to hold a victim’s information at ransom. A user or organization’s critical data is encrypted so that they cannot access files, databases, or applications. A ransom is then demanded to provide access.

# Attack Tactics:

It will affect the specific folder of your computer or you can destroy the entire operating system of your victim.
